# ShowMyShows

This is an application in which users can log in (authentication in the future) and start to keep their shows in orders.
This application has an appealing front-end, a sophisticated server setup, and an elegant database to store the data.
The application collects information about shows a user views, and stores the pertinent information from the API so that we can track their interests. 
We have embedded a frame so that not only can the user categorize their shows, but now they can WATCH them as well!
We utilize mySQL hosted out of JawsDB, Heroku to serve the site, Sxpress for the routing, and Sequelize for the querying.
The elegant front is built utilizing the Handlebars templating schema, BootStrap4 for the content polish, and jQuery to handle the client-side transactions. 

Welcome to ShowMyShows.
